      "shortBio": "As the Design Lead, I spearheaded the transformation of a high school book collection, converting printed content into an accessible and engaging digital experience. Through in-depth research on digital reading and accessibility, I crafted layouts, interfaces, and interactive elements that redefined the learning process.",
      "projectDescription": "The challenge began with digitizing a collection of printed books, converting them initially into HTML5. This first version encountered significant issues, including performance, accessibility, and difficulties in reading on mobile devices due to the original printed layout. As the Design Lead, I was driven by the need to enhance the user experience, especially for those relying on accessibility tools.\n\nWe faced the obstacle of working with materials initially produced for print, requiring careful extraction and adaptation of content. After extensive research on digital reading, UX, and accessibility, I implemented a robust design system with interactive prototyping and optimized interfaces for a fluid and accessible reading experience.\n\nThe outcome was a comprehensive app with over 200 books transformed into digital versions, an intuitive library interface, and a hybrid functionality allowing students to reference both digital and printed books. With over 5,000 Android downloads, the impact was evident: expanded accessibility and a more inclusive learning experience.\n\nThroughout this project, I learned programming in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SCSS, and deepened my knowledge in UX, digital editorial design, and frameworks like React and Next.js. If I could redo the project, I would focus on further simplifying the experience and centering it around accessibility, adding advanced annotation features to enrich student interaction with the content."
