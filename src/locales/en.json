    "year": "1989",

    "bio": "Married to Vanessa and father of Liz, born in Campinas and living in São Paulo since childhood. Studying design and animation in Vancouver broadened my creative perspective. As a UI/UX Designer, I focus on solving visual problems simply and functionally to enrich the user experience. I value research and work with hypotheses and data to optimize processes and automate workflows, seeking continuous improvement. In my free time, I enjoy video games, board games, series, movies, anime, and reading — from fiction to Bible studies. I also love learning about subjects that spark my curiosity."
